Due to the pandemic situation, I took many tests online and I was curious how I could do a test with automatic scoring on my own.
So I created a desktop application from which a student can choose from the three programming languages (Java, C ++, Python) in which to take the test. 
The test has answer options of which only one is correct and at the end the student receives the score. I wrote the code in the Java programming language and
it is my first project in this language. I started learning on my own because I liked it and I am excited to learn as much as possible.
